This project presents trajectory planning and simulation for a SCARA robot performing a pick-and-place task using MATLAB and the Robotics Toolbox. Two approaches are implemented and compared: joint-space trajectory planning based on piecewise linear–parabolic blends (LIPB), and task-space trajectory planning using linear Cartesian interpolation parameterized by LIPB with Jacobian-based constraint enforcement. 

The robot transfers multiple chips from a feeder to designated PCB locations while satisfying joint limits, velocity and acceleration constraints, and collision-avoidance requirements.

The animation of the robotic arm moving through the trajectories can be developed by running the code.
